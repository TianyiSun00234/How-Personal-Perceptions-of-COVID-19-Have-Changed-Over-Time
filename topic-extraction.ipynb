You actually need to see the topics to know if your model makes sense or not. As for K-menas, LDA converges and the model makes sense at a math level, but it does not mean it makes sense at a human level.\n* Cleaning your data: adding stop words that are too frequent in your topics and re-running your model is a common step. Keeping only nouns and verbs, removing templates from texts, testing different cleaning methods iteratively will imporve your topics. Be prepared to spend some time here. \n* Alpha, Eta. If your are not into technical stuff, forget about these. Otherwise, you can tweak alpha and eta to adjust your topics. Start with 'auto', and of the topics are not relevant, try other values. I recommend using low values of Alpha and Eta to have a small num of topics in each document and a small num of relevant words in each topic. \n* Increase the num of passes to have a better model. 3 or 4 is a good num, but you can go higher. \n\n**Assessing results:** If your model follows those 3 criteria, it looks like a good model. \n* are your topics interpretable? \n* are your topics unique? (two different topics have different words)\n* are your topics exhaustive? (are all your documents well represented by these topics)\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np #
